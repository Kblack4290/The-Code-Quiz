# The-Code-Quiz
 !(https://kblack4290.github.io/The-Code-Quiz/)

My objective to create a quiz on basic coding knowledge. There are 5 questions to answer. 

Once the user starts the quiz the timer will begin at 60 seconds. If the user answers a questions wrong then they will be deducted 10 seconds from the timer. 

The users score will be based off of how many seconds are left on the timer. 

If the timer reaches 0 or the user answers all of the questions then their score will appear. 

The user can then submit their initials to record their high score on the leader board.
